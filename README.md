# SE-Assignment-5
Installation and Navigation of Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
 Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of the installation and navigation of Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Installation of VS Code:
   - Describe the steps to download and install Visual Studio Code on Windows 11 operating system. Include any prerequisites that might be needed.

   Prerequisites: Ensure your system meets the minimum requirements for VS Code. You need a Windows 10 and above(or compatible) operating system and a reliable internet connection. You will also require administrative privelages.

   Download VS Code:
1. Go to the Visual Studio Code website.
2. Click on the "Download for Windows" button to download the installer.
3. Run the Installer:
Once the download is complete, open the downloaded .exe file.
Follow the prompts in the installer. Choose the installation location and select additional tasks like adding VS Code to the PATH.
4. Complete Installation:
Click "Install" to begin the installation process.
Once installation is complete, click "Finish" to exit the installer.
5. Launch VS Code:
After installation, you can launch VS Code from the Start Menu or by searching for "Visual Studio Code" or in gitbash by typing (code .).

2. First-time Setup:
   - After installing VS Code, what initial configurations and settings should be adjusted for an optimal coding environment? Mention any important settings or extensions.

a. Set Up Settings:
Open VS Code and navigate to File > Preferences (or press Ctrl + ,) to customize settings such as theme(darkmode or lightmode), font size and keybindings.

b. Install Essential Extensions:
Install extensions from the Extensions view (Ctrl + Shift + X). Essential extensions for web development include:
1. Live Server: Launch a local development server with live reload.
2. ESLint: JavaScript linter for identifying and fixing code errors.
3. Prettier: Code formatter for consistent code styling.
4. python
5. python debugger
6. pylance
7. code runner
8. dart
9. flutter

c. Configure Git Integration:
If using Git, configure VS Code to integrate with Git for version control. Initialize repositories and manage commits directly within VS Code.

3. User Interface Overview:
   - Explain the main components of the VS Code user interface. Identify and describe the purpose of the Activity Bar, Side Bar, Editor Group, and Status Bar.

(a.) Activity Bar- Provides quick access to different views like Explorer, Search, Source Control, and Extensions.
1. Explorer: Allows navigation through files and folders in your project.
2. Search: Provides search functionality to find files and text within your project.
3. Source Control: Integrates with version control systems (e.g., Git) to manage changes to your codebase.
4. Run and Debug: Provides access to run and debug functionalities, including configurations and debugging sessions.
5. Extensions: Allows managing VS Code extensions for additional features and functionalities.

(b.) Side Bar- Contains the Explorer (file navigation), Search, Source Control (Git), and Extensions views.
1. Explorer: Displays the file structure of your project. You can open, create, delete, and organize files and folders directly from here.
2. Search: Facilitates searching for files, symbols, or text within your project. Results are displayed in a separate panel.
3. Source Control: Shows Git or other version control system status, allowing you to stage, commit, and manage changes to your codebase.
4. Extensions: Manages installed extensions, allowing you to search for new extensions, enable/disable, uninstall, or update them.

(c.) Editor Group- Where open files are displayed as tabs or split panes for multitasking.
1. Tabs: Each file you open appears as a tab within the Editor Group. You can switch between tabs to work on different files.
2. Split Panes: Allows splitting the Editor Group horizontally or vertically to view and edit multiple files simultaneously.

(d.) Status Bar- Displays information about the current file, Git branch, and encoding.
1. File Encoding: Displays the encoding (e.g., UTF-8) of the current file.
2. Line Endings: Shows the line endings (e.g., CRLF, LF) used in the current file.
3. Language Mode: Indicates the programming language mode of the current file.
4. Git Branch: Shows the current Git branch and status (e.g., clean, changes pending).
5. Errors and Warnings: Highlights any errors or warnings in your code.
6. Notification Area: Displays notifications and progress indicators for tasks like extensions installation or updates.

4. Command Palette:
   - What is the Command Palette in VS Code, and how can it be accessed? Provide examples of common tasks that can be performed using the Command Palette.

It allows running command-line tasks without leaving the editor, integrates seamlessly with workspace, and supports multiple instances.
accessed from the three dots (...) on the activity bar or  Ctrl + Shift + ` 

examples of common tasks
one can use the gitbash terminal to push changes and commit to github
one can run a live development server i.e python manage.py runserver
git pull changes from a remote repository

5. Extensions in VS Code:
   - Discuss the role of extensions in VS Code. How can users find, install, and manage extensions? Provide examples of essential extensions for web development.

To find and install extensions in VS Code:
1. Extensions View: Open the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar or using Ctrl + Shift + X.
2. Search and Install:
Use the search bar to find extensions by name or functionality (e.g., "Python", "GitLens").
Click on an extension to view details such as description, version, rating, and publisher.
Click "Install" to install the extension.
3. Recommended Extensions: VS Code provides curated lists of recommended extensions for popular languages and frameworks, making it easier to discover useful extensions.

After installing extensions:
1. Enable/Disable: Enable or disable extensions as needed. Disabled extensions are not active but can be quickly enabled again.
2. Update: VS Code automatically checks for updates to installed extensions. You can manually update extensions from the Extensions view.
3. Uninstall: Remove extensions that are no longer needed by clicking on the gear icon next to the extension and selecting "Uninstall".

Essential extensions for web development include:
1. Live Server: Launch a local development server with live reload.
2. ESLint: JavaScript linter for identifying and fixing code errors.
3. Prettier: Code formatter for consistent code styling.
4. python
5. python debugger
6. pylance
7. code runner
8. dart
9. flutter

   To set up and start debugging a program in VS Code:

1. Setup:
Install necessary debuggers or extensions (e.g., Debugger for Chrome for JavaScript debugging).
Open the file you want to debug.
2. Start Debugging:
Press F5 or go to Run > Start Debugging.
Set breakpoints by clicking on the left gutter of the editor.
3. Features:
